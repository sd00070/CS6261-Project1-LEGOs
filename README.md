# Project 1: Sorting LEGOs by size and color

Thanks for looking at my readme!
I know it isn't in the requirements, but every good git repo should have one.

I will be placing my notes here: notes about the project,
notes to be seen by the professor, and notes to myself to keep track of things.

I will try to remember to keep the readme up-to-date with every commit,
but I'm make sure that at least every push has an appropriate readme.
